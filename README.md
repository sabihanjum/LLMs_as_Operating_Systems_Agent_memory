# LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory  

## Overview  
This repository documents my learning and exploration journey in **"LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory"**. The course dives into how to simulate agent memory, manage multi-agent orchestration, and program context-aware AI systems.  

## Key Learnings  
- **Agent Memory Programming**: Understanding how AI agents retain and retrieve relevant information.  
- **Memory Retrieval Optimization**: Techniques for prioritizing memory retrieval based on context and temporal significance.  
- **Editable Memory**: Adapting and fine-tuning memory for evolving use cases.  
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Building systems where agents collaborate effectively using shared or individual memory.  

## Contents  
This repository contains the following notebooks and resources:  
1. **[Building Agents with Memory](./building_agents_with_memory.ipynb)**  
   - Simulates agents with contextual memory.  
2. **[Editable Memory](./editable_memory.ipynb)**  
   - Demonstrates methods for updating and refining agent memory dynamically.  
3. **[Multi-Agent Orchestration](./multi_agent_orchestration.ipynb)**  
   - Explores how multiple agents interact and manage memory collaboratively.  

## Applications  
- Developing smarter virtual assistants and chatbots.  
- Enhancing decision-making systems in AI through memory simulation.  
- Creating adaptive, multi-agent platforms for complex tasks.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Extend agent memory to include long-term memory simulations.  
- Explore use cases in real-world applications such as customer service and healthcare.  
- Integrate reinforcement learning for enhanced decision-making.
